CREDITS for EMECHS Scheme
--------------------------
The initial primary developer of EMECHS was Joseph Osako, Jr  <JoeJr@osakoweb.com>, aka Schol-R-LEA;2, who wrote the original code for parsing the various types of objects and for handling linked lists.

Much of the credit for this project goes to Peter Michaux, whose series of articles entitled "Scheme from Scratch" (http://michaux.ca/articles/scheme-from-scratch-introduction) served as an inspiration and a guide. Additional credit is given to Abdulaziz Guhloum, whose paper "An Incrememntal Approach to Compiler COnstruction" was a key guide for both this project and Michaux's.
